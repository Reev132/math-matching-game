This was a semester-long team project completed with one partner as part of a Computer Architecture course (CS 2340).
🛠️ I have contributed the following:
- Implemented grid formatting logic to ensure the game board is neatly displayed.

- Developed a multi-dimensional array structure to store card values and manage the grid-based coordinate system.

- Built the input validation logic to ensure player-entered row and column values stay within the 1–4 range.

- Initialized card assignment values used to define and identify matching card pairs on the grid.

- Coded the core matching logic that hides both selected cards when they do not match.

Please view 'FinalProject.mov' and read 'User Manual.pdf' to familiarize yourself with how to run this game.
