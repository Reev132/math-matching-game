This was a semester-long team project completed with one partner as part of a Computer Architecture course (CS 2340).
üõ†Ô∏è I have contributed the following:
- Implemented grid formatting logic to ensure the game board is neatly displayed.

- Developed a multi-dimensional array structure to store card values and manage the grid-based coordinate system.

- Built the input validation logic to ensure player-entered row and column values stay within the 1‚Äì4 range.

- Initialized card assignment values used to define and identify matching card pairs on the grid.

- Coded the core matching logic that hides both selected cards when they do not match.
