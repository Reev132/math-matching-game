00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:06,230
This video will show how the game works, so let's get started.

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,750
As you can see here, it shows instructions,

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:12,550
a grid with the asterisks, a timer showing the time elapsed,

4
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:17,470
and the amount of unmatched cards remaining. And this is how the game asks for coordinates,

5
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:20,870
say i want row 1, column 1. It's asking me for a row number,

6
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,830
so i press 1 and enter. And column number, I press 1,

7
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:29,910
enter. It hides a card. And then, if I want to, it will ask me for second card

8
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:36,230
want to reveal. So I want row 3, column 1. So i write 3, 1

9
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:39,230
and [it] matches. And as you just heard, it play a sound when you match

10
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:45,670
the cards. But if I don't match a card, this will

11
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:50,790
happen. It will just say "No match, try again.". And then you try

12
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,390
again. If you do not write 1,

13
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:57,590
2, 3 or 4 for a coordinate, you will get an error. So assume

14
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:03,830
I write [row] 5, [column] 5, you'll get message saying that the coordinate is invalid.

15
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:09,110
So [this would] also be a problem if you write 0, this would also be invalid.

16
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:13,510
So any number that's either 0, or 5 and above,

17
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,000
the program will not work.

18
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,350
You will be asked if you want to play again.

19
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,270
So if I do want to play again, I'll press 'yes', and the whole game resets to what

20
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,670
it was before. So I just do the same thing as usual. And if I don't want to play

21
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:47,350
again, I just press 'end' to end the game, and the program exits

22
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,510
and that's pretty much it.
